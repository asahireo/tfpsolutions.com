Since the introduction of sustainability reporting by Bursa Malaysia, TFP has been committed to deliver long-term sustainable values with a view to grow and maintain successful business to all its stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees and the community. We recognize the importance to strike a sustainable balance between our business pursuits and incorporating sustainable values of workplace, marketplace, environment and community.<\/p><h3>\u00a0<\/h3><h3><strong>Community Engagement<\/strong><\/h3><div class=\"paragraph\">TFP has always played its role in giving back to the community through various CSR programs in the past. In 2017, the Group collaborated with Autism Cafe Project (ACP) to raise awareness about autism and most importantly to embrace people with special needs into the\u00a0workforce.<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">\u00a0<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">The Autism Caf\u00e9 Project, was founded in August 2016 by Mohd Adli\u00a0Yahya, father of an autistic child. Adli\u2019s vision for the Autism Caf\u00e9\u00a0Project is to provide a safe space for individuals with autism to undergo training to learn some basic skills and hopefully it will lead to\u00a0some employment opportunities.<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">\u00a0<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">With the objective to amplify ACP\u2019s effort, TFP worked with ACP on several corporate and customer events to promote the good cause. During such event, autism talk was presented. During the CIO Summit 2017 event, a few autistic youths were hired to run a popcorn stall and flyers were distributed. This initiative landed ACP with a few catering opportunities as well as an invitation to give a speech on Autism.<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">\u00a0<\/div><div class=\"paragraph\">TFP recognises the importance to strike a harmonious balance\u00a0between business pursuits and CSR. We believe that we can make a\u00a0difference in the community. We hope there will be more businesses and individuals who will come forward and support this meaningful\u00a0project \u2013 Autism Cafe Project.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><\/div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-603 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tfp.com.my\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/img-9840-300x225-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><div><div class=\"paragraph\"><h3><strong>Workplace Development<\/strong><\/h3><p>In TFP, employees are highly valued as assets.
