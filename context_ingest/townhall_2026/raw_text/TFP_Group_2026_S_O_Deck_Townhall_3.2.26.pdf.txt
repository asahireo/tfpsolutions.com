1) Sales Strategy: KPI + Weekly Operating Rhythm
TFP Group | 2026 Business Plan
Sales operating system (non-negotiables)
• CRM is the single source of truth (pipeline, forecast, next step, close date)
• KPI scorecard per salesperson (weekly) + manager coaching
• 3× pipeline coverage (next 90 days) to hit the revenue plan
• Weekly cadence: Monday pipeline, Wednesday deal coaching, Friday Mktg 
alignment
• Rule: “No CRM entry, no commission”
Weekly KPI scorecard (per AE)
• New meetings: 8–12
• Proposals: 3–5
• New pipeline added: RM 150k–300k
• Pipeline coverage: ≥ 3.0× (90 days)
• Forecast accuracy: ±10% monthly
Weekly meeting cadence

6) Sales Compensation & Expense Policy (Motivation & Best Practice)
TFP Group | 2026 Business Plan
Objective: reward performance, increase accountability, and remove friction for selling activities
Commission best-practice structure
• OTE model: Base + Variable or % of Net Invoice Value
• Commission paid on collected revenue or signed milestones
• Accelerators above 100% quota (e.g., 1.25×–1.5× payout rate)
• SPIFs for priority products / promotions (limited-time)
• Team bonus for delivery quality (protect margin + references)
Controls (avoid disputes)
Clear crediting rules • CRM hygiene required • Approvals for discounting • Clawback 
on cancellation
Travel & entertainment (T&E) policy
• Allow claims with pre-approval thresholds (local vs outstation)
• Clear limits: mileage, hotel caps, meal caps, client entertainment
• Require receipts + purpose + customer name in claims
• Reimburse within 7–14 days (fast turnaround motivates usage)
• Use simple tools (Google Form/Expense app) + finance audit monthly
Why this matters
Removes friction for prospecting • enables more meetings • improves close rate • 
supports partner selling
