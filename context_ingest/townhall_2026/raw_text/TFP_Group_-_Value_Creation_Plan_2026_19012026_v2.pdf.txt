TFP Solutions Berhad and its Group of Companies 
 
Value Creation Roadmap:  
Share Price Re-rating & Revenue Trajectory & KPIs for all employees  
 
1. Executive Summary 
 
TFP Solutions Berhad and its Group of Companies (“TFP Group ”) are at an 
inflection point. The Group possesses a proven end-to-end AI & Digital Platform 
ecosystem with strong gross margins,but remains undervalued due to execution 
gaps, liquidity pressure and a cost structure ahead of revenue scale  
 
This Value Creation Roadmap restructures TFP Group into a 4-engine operating 
model, introduces hard revenue-linked KPIs for all employees & sets out a clear 
staged pathway to 
 
This plan restructures TFP Group into a 4 -engine operating model, introduces 
hard revenue-linked KPIs for all employees & sets out a clear staged pathway 
to: 
 
No. Focus Area 2026 2027 2028 
1. Share price re-rating RM0.10 RM0.25 RM0.40 
2. Monthly Recurring Revenue 
(“MRR”): 
RM1.67 
million 
RM3 million RM4.17 
million 
 
Objective:  
 
i. Monthly Recurring Revenue (“MRR”): RM1.67 million RM3 million RM0.40 
RM4.17 million 
 
ii. To structurally transition TFP Group from opex -heavy execution to 
operating-leverage-positive growth, backed by recurring revenue, margin 
discipline & governance credibility. 
 
 
2. Current Situation (Fact-Based Baseline) 
 
a. Current Operating Reality  
 
Item RM million % 
Revenue 3.78   
Gross Profit 2.23 59 
Total Opex (ex-impairment) (4,24)  
Operating Loss (2.46)

b. Cash obligations 
 
Annual human capital cost = RM4.08m  
Fixed obligations & creditors = RM1.5 m  
Total key operating obligations = RM5.6m  
 
TFP Group key operating cashflow obligation: ~RM4.6m -5.6m range. 
Financing need of RM9-10m is reasonable 3. Structural Root Caus 
TFP Group key operating cashflow obligation: ~RM5.6m 
 
c. Structural Issue (Root Cause) 
 
Staff cost > 75% of revenue 
Minimum survivability threshold: ≤50% of revenue 
This is a people-to-revenue mismatch, not a product or demand failure. 
 
 
3. Strategic Target (Approved Targets)

Platform licensing 
Multi-year GLC / 
government contracts 
National AI & Digital Twin 
platform 
 
Enforce KPI ownership 
across all 4 engines. 
Institutionalise delivery & 
reporting 
High switching costs 
 
Focus sales on: high 
probability & fast conversion 
Improve MRR per employee 
via automation 
Embedded in enforcement, 
workforce, and public 
systems 
Recurring revenue contracts   
Freeze non -revenue-
generating hires 
  
 
Outcome 
Cashflow stabilised EBITDA turns positive  
MRR visibility established Predictable cashflow  
Balance sheet risk reduced 
 
TFP valued as a scalable AI 
platform, not an IT contractor

10. KPI-BASED REWARD FRAMEWORK 
(What Employees & Management Get When KPIs Are Met) 
 
i. Reward Layers (Simple, Enforceable) 
 
Core Principle of Reward: 
a. Rewards are paid only from value created, not from hope or effort. No KPI met = no 
reward. 
b. Reward layers, applied progressively as TFP stabilises and scales. 
c. When It Applies 
i. Only after monthly MRR target is met. 
ii. Only if gross margin is protected. 
iii. Only if cashflow is neutral or improving 
d. 5% –10% of incremental MRR is allocated to a KPI Bonus Pool and paid quarterly, not 
monthly.

This is to avoids sales wins but Company have insufficient incoming cashflow 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This rewards over-performance prevents entitlement culture is board-defensible.

11. Why the Value Creation Plan Is credible: 
 
i. Sales created from TFP Group existing ready products and not hypothetical 
technology or product. 
ii. Addresses root cause (people vs revenue). 
iii. Anchored to cash, gross margin, and MRR 
iv. Execution ownership is named 
v. KPIs setting is Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reviewable and Time 
Bound (S.M.A.R.T goals setting) 
 
 
12. Placement & Tranche Justification (Board Visibility) 
 
Tranche Price Justification 
1 RM0.15 RM1m MRR + governance signal 
2 RM0.25 RM3m MRR + EBITDA positive 
3 RM0.40 – RM0.50 Platform dominance + cash surplus 
 
Milestones: 
i. MRR growth: +20% – 25% Quarter on Quarter (QoQ) 
ii. 2–3 enterprise wins per quarter 
iii. Gross Margin maintained >55% 
iv. Board-approved KPI scorecards 
 
 
13. Board Resolution (Suggested) 
 
TFP Solutions Berhad Board of Directors approves  
 
a. 4-Engine Operating Model & Growth, 
b.  KPI & Reward framework,  
c. capital stabilisation plan 
d. staged value creation roadmap, and  
e. mandates TFP M anagement to execute with periodic reporting against 
agreed KPIs. 
 
Bottom Line (Board-Level) 
 
This plan converts TFP Group from: 
 
Financial stress → operational stability → scalable platform leader with a clear, 
auditable pathway from 3 sen – 5 sen → 10 sen → 25 sen → 40 sen, backed 
by real revenue and not narratives.
