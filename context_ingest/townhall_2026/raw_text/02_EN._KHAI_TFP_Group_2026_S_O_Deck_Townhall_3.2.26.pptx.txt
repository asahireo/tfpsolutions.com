6) Sales Compensation & Expense Policy (Motivation & Best Practice)
TFP Group | 2026 Business Plan
Objective: reward performance, increase accountability, and remove friction for selling activities
Commission best-practice structure
OTE model: Base + Variable or % of Net Invoice Value
Commission paid on collected revenue or signed milestones
Accelerators above 100% quota (e.g., 1.25×–1.5× payout rate)
SPIFs for priority products / promotions (limited-time)
Team bonus for delivery quality (protect margin + references)
Controls (avoid disputes)
Clear crediting rules • CRM hygiene required • Approvals for discounting • Clawback on cancellation
Travel & entertainment (T&E) policy
Allow claims with pre-approval thresholds (local vs outstation)
Clear limits: mileage, hotel caps, meal caps, client entertainment
Require receipts + purpose + customer name in claims
Reimburse within 7–14 days (fast turnaround motivates usage)
Use simple tools (Google Form/Expense app) + finance audit monthly
Why this matters
Removes friction for prospecting • enables more meetings • improves close rate • supports partner selling
