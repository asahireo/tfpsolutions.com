Today, most organizations emphasize data to
drive business decisions, but data alone is not
the goal. Facts and figures are meaningless if
we cannot gain valuable insights that lead to  
more informed action.
Analytics solutions offer ways to leverage  
business data, with multiple levels of analytics,  
ranging from descriptive, diagnostic,  
predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
